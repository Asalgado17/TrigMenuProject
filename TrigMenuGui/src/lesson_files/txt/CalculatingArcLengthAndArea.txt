Arc Length:
The arc length is the distance along the curved line of a circle's circumference, corresponding to a given central angle. 
The formula for arc length (s) is given by:



s=r×θ

s is the arc length,

r is the radius of the circle, and

θ is the central angle (in radians).
Example:
If a circle has a radius of 5 units and a central angle of 3/π radians, 
the arc length would be 5× 3/π units.

Area of a Sector:
The area of a sector is the region enclosed by an arc and two radii drawn to the endpoints of the arc. 
The formula for the area of a sector (A) is given by:

A= 1/2r^2θ


A is the area of the sector
r is the radius of the circle
θ is the central angle (in radians).

Example:
If a circle has a radius of 7 units and a central angle of 4/π radians, the area of the sector would be 
1/2×7^2= pi/4 square units
​

Important Note:
Make sure that the central angle is in radians when using these formulas. If your angle is in degrees, you may need to convert it to radians first.
