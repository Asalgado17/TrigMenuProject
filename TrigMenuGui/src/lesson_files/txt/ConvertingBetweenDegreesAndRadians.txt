Degrees to Radians:
To convert degrees to radians, you can use the following formula:
radians = (pi/180) * degrees

To convert 45 degrees to radians:
radians =(pi/180)*45

radiens = pi/4

Radians to Degrees:
To convert degrees to radians, you can use the following formula:
radians = (180/pi) * degrees

To convert pi/3 Radians to Degrees:
radians =(180/pi)*45= pi/3

Degrees = 60
 
 
 Important Notes:
A full circle is 
360∘

 or
  
2π radians.
