Trigonometric Functions:
Trigonometric functions are mathematical functions that relate the angles of a triangle to the ratios of its sides. These functions are widely used in mathematics, physics, engineering, and various other scientific disciplines.

Key Trigonometric Functions:
1. Sine Function (sin):
In a right-angled triangle, the sine of an angle (

θ) is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the hypotenuse.
Mathematically, for a right triangle with angle θ:
⁡
sin(θ)=Opposite/Hypotenusesin
​
 
2. Cosine Function (cos):
The cosine of an angle (θ) is the ratio of the length of the side adjacent to the angle to the hypotenuse.
In a right triangle:
cos
⁡
cos(θ)= Adjacent/Hypotenuse

​
 
3. Tangent Function (tan):

⁡

The tangent of an angle (θ) is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the side adjacent to the angle.
In a right triangle:

tan(θ)= Opposite/Adjacent

1. Cosecant Function  (csc or cosec):
The cosecant function is the reciprocal of the sine function.
csc(θ): 1/sin(θ)

3. Cotangent Function (cot or ctg):
The cotangent function is the reciprocal of the tangent function.
cot(θ)=1/tan(θ)
​or
cot(θ)=sin(θ)/cos(θ)​.
